# fibonacci
In-class assignment

Write a program named Fibonacci.java :
- Create an array of ints with 10 elements.
- Calculate each value in the Fibonacci sequence and store these in sequence in the array.
The formula for a Fibonacci sequence is:
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
These ‘seed values’ must be set by you: F0 = 1, F1 = 1
- Output to screen the results of your work in this format:
<array index>: <element value>


Modify your program so it can handle any number of elements in your array:

- Initialize the 1st two elements of your array to 1, 1 using an array initializer

Your code should prompt the user for the number of elements of the Fibonacci sequence to

calculate.



You should manually test your program manually for boundary conditions. As you find bugs or

issues you should modify your code in ways that correct or prevent the problem conditions. Make

sure to document these corrections in your code by using clear comments.

Think of a clever and inventive way to check the correctness of each Fibonacci element as you

calculate it. There is a way to do this without having to know any details about data types or

otherwise.
